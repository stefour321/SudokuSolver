# SudokuSolver
This is a multi-threaded C++ program that solves multiple Sudoku puzzles for you. It takes in a command line argument that is the path to an input Sudoku file. 
There is a sample input file called input_sudoku.txt included in the repo. It uses multi-threading to dynamically determine the maximum number of threads 
that can run concurrently on your computer.
